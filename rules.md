# The Extremist Map - RP System

This document is intended to be used as a ruleset for role-playing fictional nation states. In particular, the rules as described below are written with the Discord Map Game "The Extremist Map" in mind.

## First and Most Important Rule

If a rule is not fun, it is not valid.

## Nations

Each nation has an alignment on the Political Compass, as well as five attributes governing the state of affairs in the nation.

### Alignment

Each nation's government is ideologically aligned with a general ideological family. These include, but are not necessarily limited to:

- Authoritarian Left
- Authoritarian Right
- Libertarian Left
- Libertarian Right

### Attributes

Each nation has five attributes: Culture, Economy, Military, Politics and Technology

#### Culture (CUL)

**Culture** governs all cultural events, like a controversial book release or a state-mandated role-playing game. This attribute also affects the strength of the majority or state religion (or atheism).

#### Economy (ECO)

**Economy** represents the economic resources available to a nation. This encompasses capital (a.k.a. the means of production), labour, land and knowledge.

#### Military (MIL)

The **Military** attribute governs all events regarding military maneuvers, armament, the building of military bases and harbours, and war. The larger this attribute is, the stronger the nation's military.

The Military attribute is always constrained by the Economy attribute. If MIL exceeds ECO, the nation suffers repercussions, with POL continually decreasing until MIL does not exceed ECO anymore.

#### Politics (POL)

The **Politics** attribute represents the political stability of the nation. A low POL value is more likely to have secessionist movements and political unrest. A POL of 0 experiences a civil war or, if MIL is high, a coup d'Ã©tat.

#### Technology (TEC)

**Technology** represents the technological progress a nation has made since the start of the game. Initially, this attribute is zero for all nations, representing the general tech level at the start of the game.

Technologies may be locked behind a certain threshold. For example, if at the beginning of the roleplay, the world stands just before the invention of airplanes, a TEC of 1 may represent the availability of simple airplanes, while a TEC of 3 represents airplanes big enough for military and commercial use, a TEC of 10 airplane carriers, and a TEC of 20 space flight and rockets.
