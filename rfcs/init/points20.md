# 20 Points System

Initially, a nation receives 20 points to freely spend on attributes. All attributes must be spent. If some points are not allocated, they will be lost forever.

It should be pointed out that not allocating any points to CUL and ECO will lead to the nation ceasing to exist *immediately*.
